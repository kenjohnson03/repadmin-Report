Simple way for management / administrators to view the health of the AD replication. \r\n2. Especially handy because it displays only the most severe partition replication issue and by doing so eliminates viewing every partition replication.\r\n3. Displays the most severe issues on top.\r\n4. Color codes the status for each servers replication.\r\n5. Two views allow a quick snapshot of the forests health for management and a more detailed replication screen for the administrators.\r\n\r\n### This is a work in progress\r\nMy focus is simplicity and accuracy.  If you have anything to suggest or add please let me know.\r\n","tagline":"Tool to check the status of every domain controller in an MS AD forest and view the status very easily.
